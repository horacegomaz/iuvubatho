The post comes from the nvidia subreddit, original here (https://www.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/7iywzu/titan_v_is_a_doubleprecision_monster/) The benchmark is here ( The text from the nvidia sub by the OP, /u/hellotanjent is below: Just finished running some Sandra benchmarks once I was able to get a copy - the double-precision compute numbers are ridiculous. 
Another useful feature of SiSoftware Sandra Lite is its online reference database. SiSoft Sandra will benchmark your component or online connection and then compare your performance with other similar processors to give you a better idea of how an upgrade Seeing people argue in comments over this news article ( ) I begin to feel a bit bad about having just recently gotten a 7700k. I didn't expect the new processor to use a different chipset or that it would have six cores. I wish I would have waited.:( But now I wonder if I should sell my motherboard and the 7700k if the improvements to games and productivity (photoshop, illustrator, after effects) will be substain.

I know the shitstorm has calmed down a bit, but I see a lot of people asking about the performance hit, so here goes: https://imgur.com/a/JZiJB Windows update caused: 0.17% hit in single threaded and 1.7% in multithreaded Both updates together caused: 6% hit in single threaded and 8.35% in multithreaded. Benchmarking gives you a well-defined overview of the internals on your PC. It’s quite important to know everything about your PC: hard drive performance, RAM size, processor speed, GPU performance etc. Whether you’re overclocking your computer or comparing it to another computer, benchmarking. I just built my first PC and I would like to benchmark it. What do you recommend for that? I am also considering overclocking my GPU and CPU. As this will be my first time, do you have any tips or suggestions Howdy, We have some really old (10 years) Dell servers that are used as build machines to compile code, copy files out to the network, etc. We also have some not quite as old (6 years) Dell servers. We thought we could replace the really old ones with the not quite so old ones since they have better specs all around. However, when we ran some processes on them that they'd be doing, the old servers ended up finishing in about the same time, or sometimes a bit faster than the newer machines. I have finally finished listening to my 2014 trance collection! It has taken almost 2 years, and 1500 songs, but I am done. After I had finished, I finally started writing this up, an idea I have harboured since I started. I wanted to do a short writeup of what 2014 sounded like, to act as a time capsule, and as a first step for anyone new to the genre. I will cover the many talents that represented Trance music well in 2014, acts I considered to have shone particularly brightly.

My box is an 8700k, Asrock Z370m-ITX/ac, DDR4-3000, Titan V, Samsung 950 Evo. Happy to spend a few hours today running benches and posting results. Note - I'm not going to spend any (more) money buying games to benchmark, so stick to freely available stuff. I'm also not going to go to the trouble of setting up random cryptocoin wallets to test hash rates - if you have a standalone one-click benchmark for any of the crypto hashes, let me know.

This post will attempt to explain why RX Vega M GL and GH are probably not Vega based, at least not for graphics core IP. I'm going to try to go about this in a bit of an u/AdoredTV style transcript . I did a little extra research today Ohayo, Torreadorzy biznesowi nie poskromili tego wściekłego byka zwanego bessą. Wall Street sięgnął po kolejny - jeszcze gorszy spadek - od września 2009 r. Zresztą, nie tylko oni. gtBreitbart/AP: ”Trading remains volatile, and the SampP 500 is essentially flat this week even though it’s only been two days since its biggest one-day rally in six months.

I spent the last few weeks slowly tweaking my OC 7820x system and wanted to compare my "notes" with others who have done the same. I mainly use the system for computation on large data sets (10+GB) using AVX2 and soon AVX-512. Consequently, the goal hasn't been to get the highest scores in synthetic benchmarks or likes of GeekBench, CB15, etc. Instead, my goto stability benchmark has been the computation of 5 billion Pi digits using "y-cruncher v0.7.5 Build 9480" (Kotori method). I just typed this up. Let me know what you guys think. I AM NOT A FANBOY OF EITHER COMPANY. But I love competition because it drives prices down for everyone. The Ryzen 2 processor that we have the most information about currently is the Ryzen 7 2700x. This is the direct replacement for the Ryzen 7 1700x. Using leaked information, we can calculate the single-core performance of the 2700x compared to the 1700x. Then we will compare that result to the Intel Core i7 8700k, the best processor. Skylake X and AVX512: (July 6, 2017) Let's talk about Skylake X and AVX512. Because everyone's been waiting for this. Since there's currently a lack of AVX512 benchmarks and stress tests. And because of that, I've had at least half a dozen people and organizations contact me about y-cruncher's AVX512. Okay. some AVX512 benchmarks already existed. SiSoftware Sandra had some support. And my little-known FLOPs benchmark did too. But people either. My question is this: AMD's BLAS package (I think it is called BLIS) seems to finally be ready to go (mostly) and is actually available for use. Has anyone used BLIS with a threadripper (or even an epyc) CPU? (prefferably with matching data from one of the skylake-X or skylake xeon CPUs to get an idea of relative performance)? . Seeing the 9 microcenter sale for threadripper, there is literally only 1 thing stopping me from going and picking one up: Some of the most intensive codes 
Benchmarking is hard. I know that. As an engineer, I know it takes a lot of time, work and expertise to create good benchmark, and get a proper conclusions for comparing different hardware and software variants. What is very important, at least in the long run, is to not just benchmark generic programs, but also give AMD best possible treatment, or any other CPU for that matter. For example, it is very important, to not just use generic binaries compiled for generic x86 / amd64 CPU, but actual. # Retail Lip Smackers is running a contest to have a fan create the next flavour PRNewswire.com ( Taste Beauty launches 'Bye Felicia' Felicia the Flamingo lip balm at Sephora PRNewswire.com ( NYMag.com (http://nymag.com/thecut/2017/.
